# altium-libs
Libraries for Altium Designer

A cleaned up collection of parts and footprints I created and modified throughout my work.

Some of the footprints and parts are borrowed from other sources, hopefully without any violations :)

I tried to sort the components by their 'use' rather than by the manufacturer.

Almost every thing in this you can get on DigiKey/Mouser on in whatever store suits you.
3D models are grabbed from other open sources, at least those I could find at all.

Use as you please, and maybe even contribure if you have something to share.
